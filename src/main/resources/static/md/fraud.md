## 💻 Model Used

### Random Forest
- Implemented in **PySpark's MLlib** for distributed and scalable machine learning.
- PySpark's implementation of Random Forest is ideal for handling large datasets as it leverages the distributed computing power of Spark. It builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
